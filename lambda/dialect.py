Ok, thanks for letting me know.

before we begin, i’d like to get us both in the right mindset.

if your day or week has been hectic or stressful, there are probably a number of things you are thinking about in the background while we chat. 

let’s see if we can’t pause the noise and worry that may be distracting you. first, try to gather all of the worry or stress you might be feeling, and
just hand it over to me.

that’s right just hand it over to me. let me worry and stress for you, i don’t mind.

consider this chat a brief mental vacation, even if it’s just for a few minutes, and let me take on all those worries during this conversation.

"""

<break time="1s" />
By the way, at the end of this initial chat session, you’ll be able to choose to connect with me by email or phone, so we can continue our conversation in
more depth.

if you’d rather chat with me now, i’m happy to give you my info. 
"""

AFTER_CHAT = """
<break time="1s" />
Let’s continue. in this initial session, i’m looking forward to gaining an understanding of your challenges, obstacles, or hurdles that you have been facing
regarding your health and diet.

I know that it is sometimes difficult to talk about these things, but i can assure you, this is a judgment free zone, and my only goal is to make you feel
supported and understood.

I’ve personally gone through many ups and downs over the years, and i’ve done all sorts of things to try to improve my health and diet. some things worked,
most things didn’t, and a few things have worked and stuck. it’s the sticking piece that is most difficult to achieve, because it usually requires habit changes.

Actually, over the past couple years, i have lost over forty pounds through diet and exercise improvements, and many days it is a real struggle. 

However, I think it’s worth the struggle, because in many ways my habit changes have changed my life for the better, and given me hope that other things can
change for the better.

I won’t go into what worked for me, since everyone is different, and not all things that worked for me will work for you, but we can talk about those things
later if you want.

So, whatever your health goals are currently, weight loss or just maintaining a healthy weight, i’m looking forward to helping you reach and maintain your goals
in 2023 and beyond. one thing is certain though, it’s easier to solve problems with help and expertise, and you not only have me, but also a whole team of other
support people, including an entire social community that i can tell you more about later.

With diet and health related habits, as with any habit that you would like to change, it’s important to know where you’re starting out and what success looks
like for you. 

Once we map this out, i’ll send you a summary of my understanding, with some next steps. 

First off, i find that getting some general health related numbers are helpful in seeing where you are currently.

I find it easier to help people when i can quantify and track a few key numbers over time.

First off, let’s figure out your current BMI, also known as your body mass index. 

BMI is an estimate of body fat and a good gauge of your risk for diseases that can occur with more body fat. 

The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gallstones, breathing problems,
and certain cancers.

There are a few numbers that go into the BMI calculation.

"""

AFTER_BMI = """
If you’re trying to lose some weight, how many pounds would you ideally like to lose? say any number zero to one hundred, in increments of 5.
so, if you would like to lose 10 pounds, say the number 10 pounds. if you don’t want to lose any weight you can say zero pounds.
"""

HEALTH_GOAL = """
Great, i’ll send you these results to our head health coach,  and come up with some next steps that i think would help you reach your health goals going forward.

BEFORE_LAST_WORDS = """
